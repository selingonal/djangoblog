# django blog
This repository contains all of the files I am using to create a Django-based web blog as of June, 2018. This includes the documentation containting the User Stories of this project, and all the files used by the applications and their individual elements. 

# More documentation is to come as the project progresses. 
also none of this code is commented yet so good luck until that comes.
